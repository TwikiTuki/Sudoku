## Backtracking Sudoku

This project consist of a sudoku solver based on the backtracking algorithm. 

It is possible to go through some preloaded sudokus or modify one of them into a complete new one.

This project is web based and a running server is needed. 

One easy option to set a server is:   
  ``` python3 -m http.server ```  
  
Have in mind that running a server this way is discouraged in production environments.
